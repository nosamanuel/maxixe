Maxixe
======
Burr Gherkins, Python's stubby little cousin to Ruby's Cucumber.

This aims to be a sane, Pythonic implementation of the `gherkin`_ style of
testing in the Python language.

What's it mean?
---------------
Maxixe, also known as burr gherkin, also known as `cucumis anguria`_ is a type
of small cucumber with spines.  Python's kind of a thorny language compared to
the feel-good do-anything langauges like Ruby, so while Ruby has the nice
simple Cucumber for its testing, it makes since that Python tests with spines.

This is how you `pronounce`_ it.
